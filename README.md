# K-Means-Clustering-with-Python
Sure! Below is a README file template for the topic "K-Means Clustering with Python".

## Overview

K-Means Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into distinct groups (clusters). The objective of the K-Means algorithm is to divide a dataset into `k` predefined clusters based on feature similarity. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster center and then updates the cluster centers to reflect the mean of the assigned points.

This project demonstrates how to implement the K-Means Clustering algorithm using Python and the `scikit-learn` library. It also includes examples with visualizations to help understand the working of the algorithm.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

In this project, we use a sample dataset that can be found in CSV, Excel, or other formats. The dataset should have numeric features, where the K-Means algorithm will group similar data points. A common dataset used in clustering tasks is the **Iris dataset**, which is included in `scikit-learn`.

Example dataset:
- Iris dataset (available directly from `sklearn.datasets`)

## K-Means Algorithm

The K-Means algorithm works by:

1. **Choosing `k` initial centroids (randomly or by some other heuristic).**
2. **Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.**
3. **Recalculating the centroid of each cluster.**
4. **Repeating steps 2 and 3 until convergence (i.e., centroids do not change).**

## Implementation

### Step-by-Step Code

```python
# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load and prepare the dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Standardize the features (important for K-Means)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Applying K-Means Clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X_scaled)

# Predicting clusters
predicted_clusters = kmeans.predict(X_scaled)

# Getting the cluster centers
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

# Visualizing the clusters
plt.scatter(X_scaled[:, 0], X_scaled[:, 1], c=predicted_clusters, cmap='viridis', marker='o')
plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], s=300, c='red', marker='X', label='Centroids')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Visualization

The code above visualizes the clustering results with a scatter plot. Each data point is assigned a color based on its cluster, and the centroids are marked with a red 'X'.

In the example, the Iris dataset is used, and the clusters are formed based on the features of the dataset. The number of clusters is set to `3`, corresponding to the three species in the Iris dataset.

## Applications of K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering has a wide range of applications, including:

- **Customer segmentation** in marketing and sales.
- **Image compression** by reducing the number of colors in an image.
- **Anomaly detection** in network security.
- **Document clustering** for organizing large text datasets.
